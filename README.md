This repository demonstrates a common React useEffect issue and its solution. In React 18 and later, the useEffect hook with an empty dependency array is strongly discouraged unless absolutely necessary, since the effect will run after every render. This can cause unnecessary work, and will trigger warnings if the effect function creates side effects. The solution demonstrates how to properly manage the useEffect hook.
